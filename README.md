Experimented `Gherkin` features by implementing subtraction and multiplication, using a strict `ATTD` approach.

The multiplication feature is written using one `Scenario Outline` for test the scenarios with different parameters.

All the generated steps of the features refers to the same file  `CalculatorsSteps.java`.

## Task 2: ATDD - LLM

Used `ChatGPT` for make it generate the division feature of the Calculator.
